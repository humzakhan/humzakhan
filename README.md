## Hey there üëã

I'm Humza Khan, a Product Engineer and Full Stack Developer based in Montreal, Canada üá®üá¶. I started tinkering with code around the age of 14 by building multiplayer servers and gameplay mods; this turned into a lifelong passion. I'm enthusiastic about exploring new avenues in tech, and my GitHub profile is essentially a graveyard of private repositories and unfinished projects that will never see the light of the day.

Apart from creating quality software, I'm deeply passionate about our place in the universe and the physical laws that govern our very existence. This comes with a philosophical aspect that I like to contemplate from time to time. When I'm not having an existential crisis because of the aforementioned interests, listening to good techno music gets my heart beating a little too fast, and I love that.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools 

I'm fairly comfortable and work with the following tools on a daily basis.
